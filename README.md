# ConMagick - Mobile App for Events (FREE)
This is a mobile application to help present your attendees with information on your programming panels.  This is the free version of our mobile application.  This application uses a QRCode that points the mobile application to a URL that provides JSON data for both the event settings as well as all panel data.
